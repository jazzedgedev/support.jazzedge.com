    '<h2>What is JazzEdge Practice Curriculum™?</h2>
<p>JazzEdge Practice Curriculum™ (JPC) is a structured, systematic approach to learning jazz piano that guides you through essential concepts and techniques. Unlike free-form practice, JPC provides a clear path with specific focuses, organized by difficulty and musical concepts.</p>

<h2>Why Use JPC?</h2>
<p>JPC offers several advantages:</p>

<h3>Structured Learning Path</h3>
<p>Instead of wondering what to practice next, JPC provides a clear sequence of focuses that build upon each other. Each focus introduces new concepts while reinforcing previous learning.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Coverage</h3>
<p>The curriculum covers all 12 keys, ensuring you develop fluency across the entire circle of fifths. This systematic approach builds complete musical understanding.</p>

<h3>Integrated Resources</h3>
<p>Each focus includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video lessons demonstrating the concepts</li>
<li>Sheet music (PDF downloads)</li>
<li>iReal Pro files for practice</li>
<li>MP3 backing tracks</li>
<li>Clear instructions and tempo suggestions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
<p>JPC tracks your progress through each focus and key, providing visual feedback and motivation as you complete sections.</p>

<h3>Gamification</h3>
<p>Earn XP and gems as you progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>25 XP</strong> for completing each key</li>
<li><strong>50 gems</strong> for completing all 12 keys in a focus</li>
</ul>

<h2>How JPC is Organized</h2>

<h3>Focuses</h3>
<p>JPC is organized into numbered focuses (like 1.10, 1.20, 2.10, etc.). Each focus represents a specific musical concept, technique, or pattern you\'ll learn.</p>

<h3>The 12 Keys</h3>
<p>Within each focus, you\'ll practice the concept in all 12 keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>F</li>
<li>G</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>B♭</li>
<li>A</li>
<li>E♭</li>
<li>E</li>
<li>A♭</li>
<li>D♭</li>
<li>F♯</li>
<li>B</li>
</ul>

<p>This systematic approach ensures you can apply what you learn in any key, not just familiar ones.</p>

<h3>Your Current Assignment</h3>
<p>At any time, you have one active focus and one active key within that focus. This keeps your practice focused and prevents overwhelm.</p>

<h2>Where to Find JPC</h2>
<p>JPC is accessed through the <strong>Foundational</strong> tab on your Practice Dashboard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Practice Dashboard</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>"Foundational"</strong> tab in the navigation menu</li>
<li>You\'ll see your current JPC assignment displayed prominently, including:</li>
   <ul>
   <li>Focus number and title</li>
   <li>Current key</li>
   <li>Suggested tempo</li>
   <li>Video lesson</li>
   <li>Resource downloads</li>
   <li>Mark Complete button</li>
   </ul>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Foundational tab is where all JazzEdge Practice Curriculum™ content is located. This is separate from other practice items and lessons.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>If you\'re new to JPC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Practice Dashboard</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>"Foundational"</strong> tab</li>
<li>Find your assigned focus (if you don\'t have one yet, you\'ll be assigned one automatically)</li>
<li>Watch the video lesson for your current key</li>
<li>Download the resources (sheet music, backing tracks, etc.)</li>
<li>Practice the material</li>
<li>Mark the key complete when ready</li>
<li>Move to the next key automatically</li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress Through JPC</h2>
<p>As you complete keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your progress is automatically tracked</li>
<li>You earn XP for each completed key</li>
<li>When all 12 keys are complete, you earn gems</li>
<li>The next key or focus is automatically assigned</li>
<li>You can view your overall progress in the "All Focuses Progress" table</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Focus Order</h2>
<p>Focuses are numbered sequentially (1.10, 1.20, 2.10, etc.). The numbering system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicates the order you should complete focuses</li>
<li>Groups related concepts together</li>
<li>Shows progression from foundational to advanced</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> While you can jump ahead, we recommend completing focuses in order for best learning outcomes.</p>

<h2>JPC vs. Regular Lessons</h2>
<p>JPC complements regular Academy lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Lessons:</strong> Explore specific songs, techniques, or concepts</li>
<li><strong>JPC:</strong> Systematic practice curriculum ensuring comprehensive skill development</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of regular lessons as your exploration and JPC as your systematic training program.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Do I have to complete all 12 keys before moving on?</strong><br>
A: Yes, completing all 12 keys in a focus is required before moving to the next focus. This ensures comprehensive understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I skip ahead to later focuses?</strong><br>
A: The system assigns focuses sequentially. While you can review any focus, completing them in order provides the best learning foundation.</p>

A: It varies by student and focus. Take your time to truly understand each concept before moving on.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens when I complete all focuses?</strong><br>
A: You\'ll have completed the full curriculum! You can continue reviewing focuses or wait for new content to be added.</p>
